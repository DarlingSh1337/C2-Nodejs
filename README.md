# C2-Nodejs
I created a nodejs script to be able to connect all my servers simultaneously and send several attacks at the same time to increase the firepower the script is not yet finished updates will be added from here may amuse you well &lt;3


# How to use it ? 

1: Now change all information of your server

2:  host: '127.0.0.1',

3:  port: 22,

4:  username: 'C2-Username',

5:  password: 'C2-Password'

After put your commande execution of your script on line 18 and 37 

example : node c2.js ' + url + ' ' + time + ' http.txt

# And now ? 

now you can start your c2 with all your server and method simultaneously with this command ->

* node c2-node.js url time
